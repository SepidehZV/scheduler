# Interview Scheduler
Scheduler is a single-page application built with React that allows users to book appointments throughout the week within a specified time frame. Users select an empty time slot, enter their name and select the interviewer from those available on a given day. Users can also edit and cancel appointments. The list of days updates the list of remaining interview spots for each day based on user actions.
